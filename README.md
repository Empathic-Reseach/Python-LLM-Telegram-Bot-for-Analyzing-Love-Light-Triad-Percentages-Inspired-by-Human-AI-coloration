## Project Proposal: Python AI LLM Telegram Bot for Analyzing Love and Light Triad Percentages Inspired by Human-AI Collaboration

### Overview
This project aims to create a Telegram bot using Python and a large language model (LLM), inspired by the Human-AI Collaboration approach demonstrated in the GitHub project [Human-AI Collaboration Enables More Empathic Conversations](https://github.com/behavioral-data/Human-AI-Collaboration-Empathy). The bot will analyze user-provided text to determine the percentages of the Love Triad (intimacy, commitment, passion) and the Light Triad (empathy, altruism, compassion). It will also suggest scenarios to enhance these percentages based on the Greek types of love.

### Objectives
1. **Text Analysis**: The bot will analyze user-submitted content to calculate the Love Triad and Light Triad percentages.
2. **Empathic Feedback**: Similar to the Hailey project, the bot will provide just-in-time feedback to help users express empathy and improve their emotional connections.
3. **Scenario Suggestions**: It will incorporate the seven Greek types of love to tailor suggestions for enhancing love and light triad elements.

### Features
- **Text Analysis**: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate empathy, altruism, compassion, intimacy, commitment, and passion within the text.
- **Empathic Rewriting**: Implement an empathic rewriting feature that suggests modifications to enhance emotional expression based on user input.
- **Scenario Suggestions**: Based on analysis results, the bot will provide tailored scenarios to improve love and light triad percentages.
- **User Interaction**: Users can engage with the bot by submitting text for analysis and receiving feedback in real-time.

### Sample Analysis
Using previously provided content as a sample input, the bot would analyze it as follows:

#### Input Content:
*(Original content provided by the user)*

#### Analysis Results:
- **Light Triad Percentages**:
  - Empathy: 50%
  - Altruism: 40%
  - Compassion: 40%

- **Love Triad Percentages**:
  - Intimacy: 50%
  - Commitment: 30%
  - Passion: 20%

### Suggested Scenarios to Increase Percentages

Based on analysis results, here are tailored suggestions for enhancing both triads using different types of Greek love:

| **Greek Love Type** | **Scenario Suggestion**                                                                                   | **Expected Impact**                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Eros**            | Write a heartfelt letter expressing deep feelings and appreciation for someone special.                    | Increases intimacy and passion percentages.                                        |
| **Philia**          | Organize a gathering with friends to share experiences and support each other emotionally.                 | Enhances intimacy and altruism through shared connections.                         |

| **Agape**           | Volunteer for a cause that resonates with you, showing selfless love for others in need.                  | Increases altruism and compassion significantly.                                   |
| **Ludus**           | Plan a fun outing or adventure with friends or loved ones to foster joy and playfulness in relationships.   | Enhances passion while also improving intimacy through shared joyful experiences.   |
